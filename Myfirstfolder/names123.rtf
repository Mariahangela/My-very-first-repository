The first week of our OJT\
\
	For the first day of this week I decided to first familiarize the application that was assign to me, which is grab. I also wrote my thoughts about it. Second day, I\'92m still studying the process but I already created some sketch about it. Third day, I already done creating my flowchart but I\'92m still  not so familiar with this app so decided to study it more deeper. I spent my fourth and fifth day completing my visual aids and creating my thoughts  and ideas about this application\'85.\
